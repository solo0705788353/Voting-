This report presents a proposal for a public electoral and opinion polling voting system to be developed as part of the college automation.  
This is an important area for development because the opinions of students are pivotal to the future of the university, and such a system can increase awareness of important matters.  
The aim of this project is to develop an interactive voting system with which users can participate using their mobile phone.  
The project will involve three phases: the development of a graphical front-end to the voting system; the development of a method of interaction with mobile phones, and the development of a web-based administration tool.  
The results from the proposed project will be an integrated and will be displayed on the first page of website or a system capable of receiving input from mobile phones, manipulating the received data and outputting it to users in a graphical form via plasma screens located around the university campus.
